Use the files in this repository to start your assignment.

$ cd my_DSLab_folder/

$ git clone https://git-classes.mst.edu/url-for-your-repository

Complete the post-lab by creating and editing the following files in your repository folder:
* Source files like .cpp, .h, .hpp
* Code::Blocks project folder with .cbp and .layout files


Do not add:
* Compiled or generated files like a.out, your executable files, etc.
* Put the name of these files in a text file named .gitignore

Execute as many times as you want:

$ git status

$ git diff

$ git add *.cpp *.h *.hpp *.txt *.cbp

$ git add yourfile.whatever

$ git add SUBDIRECTORY/*

$ git commit -m "Informative description of the commit"

$ git push
